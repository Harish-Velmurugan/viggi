Deliverables
Think about the how your life as a student has changed due to the pandemic and please answer the following questions:

1. Through your university or college, what are the most helpful platforms/services available to you (think about virtual course work, employer connection opportunities, creative problem solving platforms, internships opportunities, etc.)? Pick one that you think is the most important and describe why in detail.
2. What were the outcomes you were able to achieve via these engagements?
3. What one tool or resource do you feel is missing and why will it help you and your fellow students succeed?
4. What is your idea for a way to fix this?

BONUS: Outside of academics, clubs and fraternities/sororities are a huge part of campus life. The relationships formed through these extracurricular activities are incredibly important but with the shutdowns, you lose the personal connection. Whatâ€™s your idea for an outlet to help members/brothers/sisters express their feelings and emotions about the pandemic in a healthy way?
