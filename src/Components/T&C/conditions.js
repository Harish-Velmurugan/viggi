these special terms, so please take the time to understand them. </p>
               
             <p>If you click "I agree" and proceed to the Project Room for this VignaTree Challenge, this Challenge-Specific Agreement
("CSA") will be a valid and binding agreement between you and VignaTree and in addition to the existing Terms of Use
for all purposes relating to this VignaTree Challenge. Please print and keep a copy of this CSA. No provisions you may
have agreed to that are specific to any other individual VignaTree Challenge will apply. </p>  
   
            <p>1.Proposed Solutions. As a Solver you may provide to VignaTree your written submission (your "Proposed Solution") to the
VignaTree Ideation Challenge to which this CSA relates ("VignaTree Challenge®"). VignaTree will make
reasonable efforts to transmit Proposed Solutions to Seekers, however, nothing herein shall be construed as requiring VignaTree
to transmit every Proposed Solution on an VignaTree Challenge to a Seeker. VignaTree will not, and does not, interpret,
edit, filter, or review Proposed Solutions. In addition, by submitting your Proposed Solution you thereby agree to provide reasonable
assistance and additional information concerning your Proposed Solution to VignaTree or the Seeker, if requested. </p>


            <p>2.Acceptance of Proposed Solution and License to Use. VignaTree will notify you within a commercially reasonable period of
time after the end of the Time Period set forth in the Challenge Statement whether your Proposed Solution has been selected by Seeker
for an Award. The Seeker will judge all Proposed Solutions against the guidelines set out in the Challenge Statement and determine, in
its sole discretion, which Proposed Solution best addresses the Challenge Statement guidelines. The Seeker has absolute and sole
discretion to determine whether to accept your Proposed Solution, or any Proposed Solution, and whether to make an Award, multiple
Awards or any Award. The meeting of the Challenge Statement guidelines does not automatically mean that the Proposed Solution will
be eligible for an Award. Proposed Solutions must NOT contain or include ideas, concepts, solutions or technology in respect of which a
third party owns or controls the intellectual property. Proposed Solutions and descriptions thereof may not include trademarks or trade
names of corporations or entities without the permission of their owners. </p>
